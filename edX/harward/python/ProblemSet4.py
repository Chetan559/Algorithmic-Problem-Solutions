Because emoji aren’t quite as easy to type as text, at least on laptops and desktops, some programs support “codes,” whereby you can type, for instance, :thumbs_up:, which will be automatically converted to 👍. Some programs additionally support aliases, whereby you can more succinctly type, for instance, :thumbsup:, which will also be automatically converted to 👍.

See carpedm20.github.io/emoji/all.html?enableList=enable_list_alias for a list of codes with aliases.

In a file called emojize.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a str in English and then outputs the “emojized” version of that str, converting any codes (or aliases) therein to their corresponding emoji.
'''

import emoji
prompt = str(input("Input:")).strip()

print("Output:",emoji.emojize(prompt, language="alias"), end='')

FIGlet, named after Frank, Ian, and Glen’s letters, is a program from the early 1990s for making large letters out of ordinary text, a form of ASCII art:

 _ _ _          _   _     _
| (_) | _____  | |_| |__ (_)___
| | | |/ / _ \ | __| '_ \| / __|
| | |   <  __/ | |_| | | | \__ \
|_|_|_|\_\___|  \__|_| |_|_|___/
Among the fonts supported by FIGlet are those at figlet.org/examples.html.

FIGlet has since been ported to Python as a module called pyfiglet.

In a file called figlet.py, implement a program that:

Expects zero or two command-line arguments:
Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font.
Two if the user would like to output text in a specific font, in which case the first of the two should be -f or --font, and the second of the two should be the name of the font.
Prompts the user for a str of text.
Outputs that text in the desired font.
If the user provides two command-line arguments and the first is not -f or --font or the second is not the name of a font, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.

import sys
import random
import pyfiglet

if len(sys.argv) ==1 or len(sys.argv) ==3 :
    figlet = pyfiglet.Figlet()
    if len(sys.argv) == 1:
        f = random.choice(figlet.getFonts())
        figlet.setFont(font=f)
    elif len(sys.argv) == 3:
        if sys.argv[1] == '-f' or sys.argv[1] == '--font':
            f = sys.argv[1]
        else:
            sys.exit("Invalid usage")
        figlet.setFont(font=sys.argv[2])
    text = input("Input: ")
    print(figlet.renderText(text))

else:
    sys.exit("Invalid usage")

In The Sound of Music, there’s a song sung largely in English, So Long, Farewell, with these lyrics, wherein “adieu” means “goodbye” in French:

Adieu, adieu, to yieu and yieu and yieu

Of course, the line isn’t grammatically correct, since it would typically be written (with an Oxford comma) as:

Adieu, adieu, to yieu, yieu, and yieu

To be fair, “yieu” isn’t even a word; it just rhymes with “you”!

In a file called adieu.py, implement a program that prompts the user for names, one per line, until the user inputs control-d. Assume that the user will input at least one name. Then bid adieu to those names, separating two names with one and, three names with two commas and one and, and 
 names with 
 commas and one and, as in the below:

Adieu, adieu, to Liesl
Adieu, adieu, to Liesl and Friedrich
Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, and Louisa
Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, and Kurt
Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, and Brigitta
Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, and Marta
Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl
